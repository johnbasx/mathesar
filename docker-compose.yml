#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INFO ABOUT VOLUMES
#
# Volumes are used by Mathesar to persist essential data.
#
# Running this compose file will automatically create a subdirectory named
# "msar" with the following file structure:
#
# msar
# ├── caddy/  (stores certificates, keys, and other information for Caddy)
# ├── media/  (stores user uploaded datafiles(.csv/.tsv) to Mathesar)
# ├── pgdata/ (stores PostgreSQL data)
# └── static/ (stores static files for Mathesar)

# MATHESAR SERVICES
#
# The next section defines various containers in a workable production setup.
#
services:
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Mathesar web service
  #
  # This service provides the main web server required to run Mathesar, using
  # our official Docker image hosted on Docker Hub
  #
  # As configured, this service exposes port 8000 to other services but not the
  # host system. This isolates it from being directly accessed  by the host
  # while allowing access via caddy.
  #
  service:
    # Removing explicit container_name to let Coolify manage it
    image: mathesar/mathesar:latest
    environment:
      # First we load the variables configured above.

      DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: config.settings.production
      
      # Force the application to use port 8002
      PORT: 8002
      GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS: "--bind=0.0.0.0:8002"

      # We set ALLOWED_HOSTS to * (allow all hosts) by default here since we are
      # relying on caddy to manage which domains could access the mathesar web
      # service.  If you do not want to use caddy add the domain(s) that you
      # want to ALLOWED_HOSTS. Doing so will restrict traffic from all other
      # domains.
      ALLOWED_HOSTS: ${ALLOWED_HOSTS:-*}

  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # PostgreSQL Database
  #
  # This service provides a Postgres database instance for holding both internal
  # Mathesar data, as well as user data if desired, using the official
  # PostgreSQL image hosted on Docker Hub
  #
  # As configured, this service exposes Postgres' default port (5432) to other
  # services, allowing the Mathesar web sevice to connect to it.
  #

  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Caddy
  #
  # This service provides a reverse proxy for the Mathesar web server, using our
  # custom Caddy image hosted on Docker Hub. That image is customized to use a
  # Caddyfile with an appropriate configuration for Mathesar.
  #
  # Specifically, this service routes the requests to backend and the web
  # frontend of Mathesar while also serving essential staic files and user
  # uploaded datafiles(.csv/.tsv). It also provides SSL certificates
  # automatically for any custom domain(s) listed in DOMAIN_NAME that you might
  # want to use to access Mathesar.
  #
  # This service maps the default port for http(80) and https(443) of the host
  # system to that of docker's for allowing access to Mathesar over http or
  # https.
  #
  # caddy-reverse-proxy:
